  "conclusion": {

    "summary": "The review summary indicates the Vueltas del Rio deposit is a potentially very robust project with a very high IRR and very short payback. This is attributed to the high average gold grade (approx. 1.4 g/t) and low operating cut-offs (0.15 to 0.35 g/t range).",
    "recommendation": "The Vueltas del Rio project is a very worthy acquisition target, and the next stage of due diligence should be undertaken without delay."
